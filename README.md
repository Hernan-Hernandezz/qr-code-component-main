## My process

The creation process was not very long since I only used basic html and css

### Created with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I usually use designs based on websites, but this time I used the figma template provided by the challenge which encouraged me to follow the guide.

### Continuous development

I loved working with a figma template, I will look for the option to continue working with this tool or a similar one.
